        Karma (1918) A Play

OLD CLOTHES:
    It was after ten o’clock, and I was still sitting in the big hail before the fire of logs,
=> Probably "hall" rather than "hail".
    and she point ed to the side of the room on my right.
=> "pointed" rather than "point ed"
    And when we got back her mother had again moved her household gods to the original family mansion
=> Probably "goods" rather than "gods"
